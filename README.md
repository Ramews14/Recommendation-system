# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project is a basic movie recommendation system built using Python. The system leverages movie and rating datasets to suggest relevant movies to users based on their ratings and preferences.

## Datasets Used
1. **movies.csv**: Contains movie details such as `movieId`, `title`, and `genres`.
2. **ratings.csv**: Contains user ratings for movies, including `userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, and `timestamp`.
